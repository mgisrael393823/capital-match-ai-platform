# LG Development AI Platform - Final Refinements

This document outlines the strategy and specific edits to complete for the Capital Match AI platform before the meeting with LG Development on Wednesday.

## Strategy

Based on the client's requirements and the CEO's notes, we need to:

1. Update the homepage to reflect all three divisions (LGA, LGB, LGD)
2. Modify the prototype to better align with the CEO's language and priorities
3. Add placeholder cards for additional functionality mentioned in the CEO's notes

## Specific Edits

### Homepage Updates

1. **Hero Section**
   - Update headline to: "AI-Powered Intelligence for Real Estate Capital, Development & Design"
   - Update subheadline to: "Automate deal sourcing, LP outreach, proposal generation, and moreâ€”built for development, construction, and architecture teams."

2. **Add "Use Cases by Division" Section**
   - Create a new component called `DivisionUseCasesSection.tsx`
   - Add this component to the HomePage between HeroSection and CapabilitiesSection
   - Feature three columns with use cases for LGA, LGB, and LGD

3. **Add Integration Visual Section**
   - Create a simple flow diagram showing:
   - Inputs: HubSpot, LoopNet/CoStar, Title Records, Emails, Procore/Sage, Pro Formas
   - Processing: AI Assistant
   - Outputs: Investor Pitch Decks, Summaries, Recommendations, Dashboards

### Prototype Page Updates

1. **Dashboard Cards**
   - Rename "Investor Match" to "LP Match + Personalized Outreach"
   - Rename "Deal Intelligence" to "Smart Deal Sourcing (LoopNet + CoStar)"

2. **Add New Placeholder Cards**
   - "Title & Transaction Intelligence" 
   - "Proposal + Pro Forma Generator"
   - "Social Media Assistant (Multi-Division)"

3. **Consider Adding Division Tabs**
   - Add tabs for LGD, LGB, and LGA to show how the interface adapts

### Additional "What's Next" Section

1. **Create a Roadmap Section**
   - Phase 1: Build LP-deal matching engine and capital raise tracker
   - Phase 2: Set up proposal + OM auto-generation tools
   - Phase 3: Integrate HubSpot for investor intelligence
   - Phase 4: Expand to LGA and LGB workflows

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Update HeroSection.tsx
- [x] Create DivisionUseCasesSection.tsx
- [x] Add DivisionUseCasesSection to HomePage.tsx
- [x] Create IntegrationVisualSection.tsx
- [x] Add IntegrationVisualSection to HomePage.tsx
- [x] Create WhatsNextSection.tsx
- [x] Add WhatsNextSection to HomePage.tsx
- [ ] Update the Prototype Dashboard cards

## Note

Ensure all edits maintain the existing styling and visual design of the site. Use the same color scheme and UI components to keep the design consistent.

## Next Steps

We've completed the homepage updates, but we still need to update the prototype page. In the next chat, we'll need to:

1. Update the dashboard card labels on the Prototype page
2. Add new placeholder cards for additional functionality
3. Consider adding division tabs to show how the interface adapts

Since we've already added important visual elements showing all three divisions on the homepage, the prototype modifications are lower priority but will still enhance the presentation.
