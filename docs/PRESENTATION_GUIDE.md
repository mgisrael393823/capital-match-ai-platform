## 3. Opening Strategy

Begin by demonstrating your deep understanding of LG Development's business and strategic goals:

> "Before diving into the platform, I'd like to acknowledge the impressive growth trajectory outlined in your 2025 Strategic Plan. Your targets of growing from $4.6M to $48M in revenue by 2034, with expansion into Denver, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Nashville, focusing on Build-to-Rent and multifamily developments, require sophisticated capital formation strategies and LP relationship management.

> Currently, your team is managing LP relationships manually through HubSpot, but lacks systematic matching with deals that aligns with your 'Access to Capital' focus area. This creates inefficiencies in targeting the right LPs for specific deals and limits your ability to meet the target of $5M in discretionary capital by Q2."

## 6. Anticipated Questions & Prepared Answers

### 6.1 Implementation & Resources

**Q: "How will this impact our day-to-day operations?"**
A: "Your team will spend less time manually reviewing deals against LP criteria and more time on high-value relationship nurturing. The system automates the matching process, surfaces the most promising LP-deal combinations, and provides actionable insights for outreach."

**Q: "What's the implementation timeline look like?"**
A: "We can show meaningful value within 4-6 weeks with the foundation components, particularly the LP Profile Engine, which directly supports your Q2 capital raise target. The full implementation follows the 6-month roadmap aligned with your strategic priorities."

**Q: "How much of our team's time will this require?"**
A: "We'll need some initial knowledge transfer sessions, particularly around your LP relationships and deal evaluation criteria. We've designed this to minimize disruption, requiring approximately 2-4 hours per week from key stakeholders during the initial setup phase."

### 6.2 Technical Questions

**Q: "How does this integrate with our existing systems?"**
A: "The platform connects directly with your current tech stack. It pulls LP data from HubSpot, construction milestones from Procore, and leverages Microsoft Teams for notifications. All integrations use secure API connections and follow your security protocols."

**Q: "What happens if our deal criteria or LP preferences change?"**
A: "The system is designed for flexibility. LP profiles and deal criteria can be updated at any time, and the matching algorithm automatically adjusts. The AI component means the system gets smarter over time, adapting to changing preferences and market conditions."

**Q: "How secure is the sensitive LP financial data?"**
A: "We implement enterprise-grade security including role-based access controls, encryption of data both at rest and in transit, comprehensive audit logging, and the ability to maintain compliance with SEC and other regulatory requirements for GP-LP communications."

### 6.3 Value & ROI Questions

**Q: "How does this directly impact our $5M capital raise target for Q2?"**
A: "The platform accelerates capital formation by identifying the LPs most likely to invest in your current deals, automating personalized outreach, and tracking commitment velocity. Our analysis suggests this can increase commitment velocity by 20-30%, directly supporting your Q2 target."

**Q: "What's the ROI calculation for this investment?"**
A: "Based on your strategic targets, the platform can help accelerate deal closings by 15-20%, increase LP conversion rates by 25%, and reduce time spent on LP-deal matching by 60%. For a $200M development target, even a 5% improvement in capital formation efficiency translates to substantial value."

**Q: "How will this help us expand into new markets?"**
A: "The platform maps LP preferences by geographic market, helping identify investors interested in your expansion targets like Denver and Charlotte. It also maintains market intelligence on construction costs and trends, supporting your strategic market entry decisions."
